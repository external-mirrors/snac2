# TODO

## Open

Investigate the problem with boosts inside the same instance (see https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2/issues/214).

Editing / Updating a post does not index newly added hashtags.

Wrong level of message visibility when using the Mastodon API: https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2/issues/200#issuecomment-2351042

Unfollowing guppe groups seems to work (http status of 200), but messages continue to arrive as if it didn't.

Important: deleting a follower should do more that just delete the object, see https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2/issues/43#issuecomment-956721

## Wishlist

Add support for subscribing and posting to relays (see https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2/issues/216 for more information).

The instance timeline should also show boosts from users.

Mastoapi: implement /v1/conversations.

Implement following of hashtags (this is not trivial).

Track 'Event' data types standardization; how to add plan-to-attend and similar activities (more info: https://event-federation.eu/). Friendica interacts with events via activities `Accept` (will go), `TentativeAccept` (will try to go) or `Reject` (cannot go) (`object` field as id, not object). `Undo` for any of these activities cancel (`object` as an object, not id).

Implement "FEP-3b86: Activity Intents" https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/3b86/fep-3b86.md

Track "FEP-ef61: Portable Objects" https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/ef61/fep-ef61.md

Integrate "Added handling for International Domain Names" PR https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2/pulls/104

Do something about Akkoma and Misskey's quoted replies (they use the `quoteUrl` field instead of `inReplyTo`).

Add a list of hashtags to drop.

Take a look at crashes in the brittle Mastodon official app (crashes when hitting the reply button, crashes or 'ownVotes is null' errors when trying to show polls).

The 'history' pages are just monthly HTML snapshots of the local timeline. This is ok and cheap and easy, but is problematic if you e.g. intentionally delete a post because it will remain there in the history forever. If you activate local timeline purging, purged entries will remain in the history as 'ghosts', which may or may not be what the user wants.

The actual storage system wastes too much disk space (lots of small files that really consume 4k of storage). Consider alternatives.

Add an RSS to the local timeline (2022-11-18T11:43:54+0100).

Dropping on input those messages that have their parent hidden is not a good idea, as children of *these* dropped messages will pass unharmed (2022-11-28T11:34:56+0100).

Idea for a new disk layout: timelines stored like in git (2 character directories and then the md5.json inside); one append-only index with entry ids, read backwards (easy because md5 binary ids have a constant size); children lists as append-only files stored inside the timeline directories with almost the same names as the parent entry; liked-by and announced-by lists as append-only files of actor ids. No _snac metadata inside the message (But, what about the referrer? With this layout, do I need it?). The instance storage may even be global, not per user; this could help in very big instances (but will this be a use-case for snac? not probably) (2022-12-04T06:49:55+0100).

Add this pull request https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2/pulls/9 (2022-12-05T12:12:19+0100).

Add an ?skip=NNN parameter to the admin page, to see older timeline (2022-12-08T08:41:11+0100).

Now that we have the 2.7 layout and Likes and Announces don't move the conversations up, finally fix the ugly # positioning (2022-12-08T08:41:27+0100).

Disable the 'Boost' button for non-public messages (technically they can be Announced, but shouldn't) (2022-12-08T08:46:24+0100).

Add support for Update + Note on input (2022-12-15T11:06:59+0100).

Hashtags have broken the Emojis; fix this (2023-01-17T09:42:17+0100).

Integrate https://codeberg.org/alderwick/snac2/commit/a33686992747f6cbd35420d23ff22717938b622 (2023-01-22T20:28:52+0100).

Add support for editing our own messages (2023-01-25T18:36:16+0100).

Implement hashtags. They are not very useful, as they can only be implemented as instance-only (not propagated), but it may help classifiying your own posts (2023-01-26T14:39:51+0100).

Refactor the queue to be global, not per user (2023-02-03T20:49:31+0100).

If there is a post in private.idx that has a parent that is in the global object database, this parent will be inserted into the list by timeline_top_level(). BUT, the new function timeline_get_by_md5() (that only looks in the user caches) won't find the parent, so the full thread will not be shown. This is BAD (2023-02-08T13:48:12+0100).

Move the output messages to the global queue (2023-02-10T12:17:30+0100).

Refactor the global queue to use a pool of threads (2023-02-10T12:17:38+0100).

Add a user-settable `purge_days`. This is not at first very hard to do, but purging posts from a user cache directory does not also delete them from the global object database and they will be kept in the indexes (unless they are also deleted from the indexes, which is a too expensive operation); this way, if another user in the same instance follows you, your posts will not disappear as you desire and that may be confusing and annoying. A different way to implement this: configure a maximum number of entries to keep and truncate the indexes in the purge. But this does not clear the disk usage, which is why I want to implement this (to implement bots that generate posts periodically and avoid the disks exploding) (2023-02-10T12:18:42+0100).

Add support for uploading the avatar, instead of needing an URL to an image. As a kludgy workaround, you can post something with an attached image, copy the auto-generated URL and use it. You can even delete the post, as attached images are never deleted (I said it was kludgy) (2023-02-15T09:31:06+0100).

Child indexes (*_c.idx) with a parent not present keep accumulating; not a real problem, but I must check why I keep storing them because I don't remember (2023-02-25T18:15:30+0100).

There are some hosts that keep returning 400 Bad Request to snac posts (e.g. hachyderm.io). I've investigated but still don't know where the problem is (2023-03-07T10:28:21+0100).

Fix `Like` and `Update` recipients (2023-03-07T10:28:36+0100).

Implement the ActivityPub C2S (Client to Server) API: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions . The Android client at http://andstatus.org/ implements it, or so it seems. UPDATE: Wrong, AndStatus starts doing an OAuth query, that is totally not ActivityPub C2S. The number of real ActivityPub C2S clients out there is probably zero. Abandoned now that I'm implementing the Mastodon API (2023-04-12T15:00:14+0200).

Edits do not refresh the HTML cache (2023-04-14T19:05:27+0200).

Add (back) the possibility to attach an image by URL (2023-05-21T20:35:39+0200).

With this new disk layout, hidden posts (and their children) can be directly skipped when rendering the HTML timeline (are there any other implications?) (2023-06-23T06:48:51+0200).
